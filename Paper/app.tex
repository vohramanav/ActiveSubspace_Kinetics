\section{$\text{H}_2$/$\text{O}_2$ reaction kinetics: high-dimensional case}
\label{sec:app}

For the high-dimensional case, we aim to investigate the impact of the uncertain
pre-exponents ($A_i$'s) as well as the activation energies ($E_{a,i}$'s) on ignition 
delay during the H$_2$/O$_2$ reaction. The $A_i$'s are considered to be uniformly
distributed in the interval, $[0.9A_i^\ast, 1.1A_i^\ast]$. The $E_{a,i}$'s for all
reactions except $\mathcal{R}_6$ -- $\mathcal{R}_9$ and $\mathcal{R}_{13}$
are considered to be uncertain and uniformly distributed in the interval: 
$[0.99E_{a,i}^\ast, 1.01E_{a,i}^\ast]$. The nominal values, $A_i^\ast$ and $E_{a,i}^\ast$
corresponding to the different reaction rates are provided in~\cite{Yetter:1991}. 

The gradient-free approach discussed earlier in~\ref{sub:gradfree} was used to compute the
active subspace. Using the iterative procedure, the convergence of the eigenvectors
was examined by tracking $\delta \hat{\mat{W}}_{1,j}^{(i)}$. In Figure~\ref{fig:conv_app} (left),
components of the converged eigenvector based on 50 samples using $\tau$ = 0.2 are plotted.
To illustrate convergence, we compare them with components of the eigenvector obtained
using 100 samples (twice as many). The variation of maximum $\delta w_{1,j}^{(i)}$ between
successive iterations during the course of the iterative procedure is illustrated in 
Figure~\ref{fig:conv_app} (right).

is plotted for successive iterations to illustrate the convergence behavior.}

The dominant eigenvector is observed to converge with only 50 samples in the 33-dimensional space which
is remarkably efficient. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:hd}, we illustrate the resulting eigenvalue spectrum and the SSP.

corresponding 1-D linear fit.}

\end{figure}
%
The second eigenvalue is observed to be roughly four orders of magnitude smaller than the first 
indicating the existence of a 1-dimensional active subspace. This is further confirmed by the SSP
 which shows that the variability in $G$ can be approximated using a 1-dimensional regression
fit ($\tilde{G}$) which could be used as a surrogate. A linear, quadratic, and a cubic fit to the SSP was performed.
The linear fit illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:hd} (right) was found to be the most accurate. In~\ref{sub:verify},
we investigate the accuracy of the 1D surrogate based on the linear fit by estimating the relative L-2
norm of its discrepancy with model evaluations at an independent set of samples, and by comparing the
respective probability distributions.

Components of the dominant eigenvector in Figure~\ref{fig:conv_app} (left) are used for estimating the
activity scores, plotted below in Figure~\ref{fig:as_33D}.

From the above plot, it can be inferred that the ignition delay is predominantly sensitivity towards $A_1$, $A_9$, and
$E_{a,1}$. Furthermore, it is moderately sensitivity towards $A_{15}$ and $A_{17}$ while sensitivity towards remaining
inputs is found to be low or negligible. Note that the sensitivity results for the pre-exponents is found to be consistent
with the 19-dimensional case presented in~\ref{sec:method}. This observation can also be exploited for reducing the 
dimensionality of the problem from 33 to 3-5 depending upon the required level of accuracy in terms of characterizing 
the uncertainty in the model output. The sensitivity-driven dimension reduction for uncertainty quantification has been
discussed in our earlier effort~\cite{Vohra:2018}. In this work, however, we focus on dimension reduction using the active 
subspace approach which is shown to yield even greater scope for dimension reduction i.e. from 33 to 1. We verify
the accuracy of the 1-d regression fit to $G(\hat{\mat{W}}_1^\top\bm{\xi})$ in the following section.

\subsection{Surrogate Verification}
\label{sub:verify}

The 1-dimensional surrogate ($\tilde{G}$) is investigated for its accuracy as well as the ability to capture the 
uncertainty in the
model output in two ways. Firstly, we estimate the relative L-2 norm of the discrepancy~($\varepsilon_d$)
between estimates of ignition delay in the case of H$_2$/O$_2$ reaction, obtained using the 
model output and the surrogate in the following equation:
%
\be
\varepsilon_d = \frac{\|G(\bm{\xi}) - \tilde{G}(\bm{\xi})\|_2}{\|G(\bm{\xi})\|_2}
\ee
%
The relative norm, $\varepsilon_d$ was estimated to be 8.50$\times10^{-2}$ based on a cross-validation test data
comprising 10$^{4}$ model evaluations. Hence, in the norm-sense, it can be said that the 1-dimensional surrogate is 
reasonably accurate. 

Secondly, we verify the accuracy of the surrogate in a probabilistic setting. In particular, we compare a histogram
plot of the model evaluations (in the cross-validation set) with a PDF evaluated on the same set of samples
using the surrogate, $\tilde{G}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:pdf_33D}. The PDF is evaluated using surrogates constructed for
a 1-dimensional as well as a 2-dimensional active subspace. 
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./Figures/pdf_comp_id_1e4}
\caption{A comparison of the histogram plot based on model evaluations and the PDF based on surrogate
predictions for ignition delay. The two plots are based on samples in the validation set.}
\label{fig:pdf_33D}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
In the above comparison, it is observed that the two PDFs are almost identical, thereby confirming a 1-dimensional
active subspace. The modal estimate from either PDF is observed to be in agreement with that
based on the histogram plot. The mean value based on the set of model evaluations used for verification as well
as the 1-dimensional surrogate was found to be 0.133, whereas, the standard deviations were found to be 0.0198 and 0.0160
respectively. Hence, while the surrogate yields an accurate estimation of the mean, the standard deviation is
under-estimated. This can be understood from the SSP in Figure~\ref{fig:hd} (right) which shows that the model
evaluations do not exactly lie on the linear 1-dimensional surrogate used to capture them. Therefore, the
1-dimensional surrogate can be used to estimate the mean as well as the modal estimate of the ignition delay in
the presence of uncertainty in the 33 parameter considered in this application. The uncertainty associated with the
ignition delay though reasonably close to the true value, is under-estimated.
